# Foody

#### A website for recipes, ingredients and a shopping list.
#### Hosted with a Firebase backend connected to the recipes, but not the shopping list.

## To Do
#### At the moment the project is built around Bootstrap and have to use Jquery to get a working navbar on mobile devices. A better solution would be to rebuild the project around ng-bootstrap (or build it manually, instead of using Jquery).
#### Implement functionality in the shopping list that increases the amount of the same ingredient, instead of adding them as another ingredient.
#### Add the shopping list to Firebase as well.
